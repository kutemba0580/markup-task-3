                    <p class="main-story-text news_p_second">
                        Before the invention of electromagnetic telephones, mechanical acoustic devices
                        existed for
                        transmitting speech and music over a distance greater than that of normal direct
                        speech.
                        The earliest mechanical telephones were based on sound transmission through pipes
                        or other physical media.
                        The acoustic tin can telephone, or "lovers' phone", has been known for centuries.
                        It connects two diaphragms with a taut string or wire, which transmits sound by
                        mechanical vibrations
                        from one to the other along the wire (and not by a modulated electric current). The
                        classic example is
                        the children's toy made by connecting the bottoms of two paper cups, metal cans, or
                        plastic bottles
                        with tautly held string.Among the earliest known experiments were those conducted by
                        the British physicist
                        and polymath Robert Hooke from 1664 to 1685.An acoustic string phone made in 1667 is
                        attributed to him.
                        For a few years in the late 1800s, acoustic telephones were marketed commercially
                        as a niche competitor
                        to the electrical telephone. When the Bell telephone patents expired and many new
                        telephone manufacturers
                        began competing, acoustic telephone makers quickly went out of business. Their
                        maximum range was very limited.
                        An example of one such company was the Pulsion Telephone Supply Company created by
                        Lemuel Mellett
                        in Massachusetts, which designed its version in 1888 and deployed it on railroad
                        right-of-ways.
                        Additionally, speaking tubes have long been common, especially within buildings and
                        aboard ships, and are still in use today.

                    <p class="main-story-text news_p_second">The telephone emerged from the making and
                        successive improvements of the electrical telegraph.
                        In 1804, Spanish polymath and scientist Francisco Salva Campillo constructed an
                        electrochemical telegraph.
                        The first working telegraph was built by the English inventor Francis Ronalds in
                        1816 and used static electricity.
                        An electromagnetic telegraph was created by Baron Schilling in 1832.
                        Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber built another electromagnetic telegraph in
                        1833 in GÃ¶ttingen.
                        Bell prototype telephone stamp Centennial Issue of 1976 The electrical telegraph was
                        first commercialised by
                        Sir William Fothergill Cooke and entered use on the Great Western Railway in England.
                        It ran for 13 mi (21 km) from Paddington station to West Drayton and came into
                        operation on April 9, 1839.
                        Another electrical telegraph was independently developed and patented in the
                        United States in 1837 by Samuel Morse.
                        His assistant, Alfred Vail, developed the Morse code signaling alphabet with Morse.
                        America's first telegram was sent by Morse on January 6, 1838, across 2 miles
                        (3 km) of wiring.
